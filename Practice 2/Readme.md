This is a basic section email. About the stacking elements in the mobile view reordered

## Instructions
The Email has two tables one aligned to the left in green color with number one and the second in blue color with the number two. When the email resize to mobile view the blue table goes down to the green.

In this case we are going to change this behavior provoking that the green table goes down to the blue. For this we need to change the order of the elements. The HTML has the following structure:

Green table aligned to the left declared into the code first then the Blue table aligned to the right second. To reorder this we need to declare the code of the blue table first and then the green table second. Try this in the folder Reordered Email
